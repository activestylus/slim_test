h2. Setup

Note: This app is running on Mysql

# bundle install
# rake db:create
# rake db:migrate
# rails server

h2. The Bug

# Visit http://localhost:3000/parents/new
# Fill in parent name and child name
# Press "Create Parent"
# Press "Edit" link on the show page
# Change name of child and press "Update Parent"

The parent now has two children instead of updating the name of the first one.

h2. Try it with Haml

# Open Gemfile and comment out: gem "slim"
# Uncomment the haml gem lines and run "bundle install" again
# Repeat the above steps

As you can see haml applies the correct behavior

Interesting sidenote: Both template engines appear to generate identical html but the behavior is quite different as youc an see.
